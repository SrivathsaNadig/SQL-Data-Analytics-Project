# Data Analysis EDA Project

## Overview

Leveraging SQL and data from a previous warehouse project, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to derive actionable insights and enhance decision-making.

## Project Highlights

- Analyzed procurement vendors to optimize intelligent procurement processes.
- Leveraged SQL for data extraction, feature engineering, and relational database analysis, selecting the right data from over 100 tables for comprehensive modeling.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL to uncover trends and patterns in the data.
- Designed a dashboard to streamline bulk ordering and reduce client decision time.
- Enhanced procurement efficiency with actionable insights and strategic recommendations.

## Technologies Used

- SQL
- Data Visualization Tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI)
- Python (for any additional analysis and visualization)
